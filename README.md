### What is it?
Well it's the best thing you might ever step over...if you have nothing better to do than filling two-dimensional arrays with ascii characters. I created it to ease the filling of friggin' 2D arrays for myself and well it's my first real library. So I try to make it as professional as possible in the range of making something that has been done a thousand times before. I still hope anybody might say "Oh yeee jeez thats exactly what I was looking for".
